          Beyond senior high school, I walk alone,
          <br>
          A different path from the ones my classmates own.
          <br>
          Each road feels strange, dark, and unclear,
          <br>
          A future unknown, yet I move with fear.
        </p>

        <p class="poet2">
          Every step I take is driven by <strong>courage</strong>,
          <br>
          Though my heart trembles at every passage.
          <br>
          The path is hard, and I’m scared to see
          <br>
          If it leads to a fall or safe ground for me.
        </p>
      
        <p class="poet3"> 
          Still, I walk on with what I have learned,
          <br>
          With skills and lessons I have earned.
          <br>
          Through darkness and doubt, I choose to stand,
          <br>
          Trusting my steps, trusting my plan.
